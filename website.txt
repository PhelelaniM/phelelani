Add another section below stack called "Industry / Domain Expertise"

Industry / Domain Specializations:
Retail - use the following icon and make sure its a small icon like you did for the stack section : "C:\Users\urban\Documents\Website Icons\franchise.png"

In the Project Section make the images smaller because they were meant to be icons - they must not occupy so much space in the projects section.
rather than a large image use these small videos to demo what the app looks like. Using the best web design principles and maitaining the look and feel of the website
make sure the video is a good representation of the project and is properly located using the best UX/UI design principles of the best portolio websites.
For the Urban DMS Intelligence project USE THE FOLLOWING short clip for the display part
I attached an eample of how it should look in the project section above the short description and github link
Here is the video : "C:\Users\urban\Documents\Website Videos\urban planning intelligence system - Made with Clipchamp.mp4"
the other projects wont have a video only this one.

I want you to add to the popups in the Stack section the same thing you did for python and aws by adding the additional info in the popup same for :
ESRI - Location Platform, ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Cloud
CARTO - Cartoframes, Carto Online, Carto Cloud


Add the following to the stack section:
Jupyter Labs - here is the link to the icon to add to the existing stack section : "C:\Users\urban\Documents\Website Icons\share.png"


Only focus on what I have explicitely told you to focus on - dont change things I did not mention in this prompt.
